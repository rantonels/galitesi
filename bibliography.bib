We derive a closed form of the transition amplitude on caustics and discuss their physical implications in the Gaussian slit (gedanken-)experiment. Application to the quantum mechanical rotor casts doubt on the validilty of Jevicki's correspondence hypothesis which states that in quantum mechanics, stationary points(instantons) arise as simple poles.},

The treatment is more descriptive than rigorous, for we aim to reach both physicists and mathematicians, including non-specialists in the field. It is our hope that an overview such as this will put into perspective the relative successes as well as shortcomings of the various techniques that have been developed and, besides delineating their usefulness in understanding the nature of the quantum regime, will also demonstrate the mathematical richness of the attendant structures.},
